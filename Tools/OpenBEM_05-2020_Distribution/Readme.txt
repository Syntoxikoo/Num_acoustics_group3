
OpenBEM
_______

OpenBEM is an implementation of the Boundary Element Method for Acoustics in Matlab. It consists of three formulations:

-2DBEM: Implementation in two dimensions, with the possibility of an impedance plane.

-3DBEM: General formulation in three dimensions.

-AxiBEM: BEM for axisymmetrical objects. Only the generator is meshed. It is possible to define non-axisymmetrical acoustical variables. See PhD thesis by Peter M. Juhl.


OpenBEM has been programmed by Peter M. Juhl and Vicente Cutanda Henriquez, with additions from colleagues and students. The purpose of this development work is:

-Investigate and improve the BEM itself using a fully accessible code.
-Conduct research in Acoustics, performing simulations for a better understanding of acoustic systems and phenomena.

Most of this work is documented in publications by the authors. A conference publication introducing the package is included.


The code is being constantly modified, depending of the needs of every project. There is neither user interface nor manual and the new user must learn OpenBEM by studying the examples and reading the help texts all functions have. It is also possible to contact the authors, who are willing to receive comments and contributions, and provide advice.

All the code is more or less under development. It is not, therefore, “user-friendly”. If the user wants to contribute to the core of the BEM, a good understanding of the BEM is required. However, the code has been tested and runs, and it is possible to use it as a tool with no deep knowledge of its workings. It is of course understood that this software is provided with no warranty. 


Conditions of use:
__________________

If OpenBEM is used, the authors would like at least an acknowledgement in the subsequent publications. If new additions are made, it is a good idea to contribute to the package and make any improvement available for all those interested. The reference to be cited is:

Structure of the package:
_________________________

There are three folders containing the three formulations. Working with one of them requires setting Matlab working directory to the given folder, and running the path generation file in it. Most of the code is self-explanatory. There are sub-folders containing:

-The core of the formulation and some utility functions that may be needed. 
-Scripts with calculation examples.
-Already made meshes (3DBEM) and importing utilities.
-Analytical solutions for simple cases in Acoustics.
-Documents

The usual way to run a simulation is one or more scripts containing:

-Parameters of the simulation.
-Mesh generation or retrieval from existing files.
-Boundary conditions: incoming waves, prescribed velocities, impedances.
-Calculation of the coefficient matrices.
-Solution of the system of equations to obtain values on the boundary.
-Definition of field points and calculation of the sound field on them.
-Presentation of results.

There are files in the root directory with guidelines that can help in this process. The thesis report "The Boundary Element Method for Sound Field Calculations", by Peter M. Juhl is the basic reference, in particular for the axisymmetrical and 3D formulations. The report can be downloaded from www.openbem.dk


Mesh generation:
________________

The mesh is generated by the "nodegen" functions in 2DBEM and AxiBEM. The package does not contain generation of 3D meshes for 3DBEM. However, some functions for importing meshes generated in ANSYS and GMSH (http://gmsh.info/) are provided.
