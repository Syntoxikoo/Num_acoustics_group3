
-5-2011: New function "meshcheck" included in 3DBEM\input. It is a replacement for "bodyfind" (VCH)

-7-2011: 2DBEM: correction to the expression of the Green's function to remove the 2*pi factor. Improvements to the examples. (VCH)

-2-2012: Some changes in the help text in "TriQuadEquat" and "amb2prop" functions. Corrections in the 3D "incoming" function. The 3D testcases have been modified accordingly and checked. (VCH)

-3-2012: CHIEF points added to the test script is “TestScatCyl" in 2DBEM. (VCH)

-4-2012: FieldPnt functions in AxiBEM\RunFiles\Version1 and AxiBEM\RunFiles\Version2 updated with proper handling of C constants.(VCH)

-4-2012: Function betag in 2DBEM gives now normalized admittance. Sign convention made consistent. Still under test.(VCH)

-5-2012: Corrections in AxiBEM to restore functionality with linear elements. Functions "nsing" and "nodegen" are affected. The example "TestSphere" shows now how to use linear elements.(VCH)

-2-2015: Revised 2DBEM able to calculate near singular integrals (thin bodies/narrow gaps). It is a quick implementation that also replaces singular integrals. The latter should be avoided in a future update.

-2-2015: Testcases were revised and some added.

-2-2015: The nodegen function was replaced by a full-feature version with basic and advanced usage, common for 2DBEM and AxiBEM. The management of the impedance is not anymore dependant on nodegen for the 2DBEM version.

-3-2015: Modifications for increased speed, 3DBEM formulation: TriQuadEquat, nsing2dTRIA (see functions' text). The first has effect for very large matrices.

-5-2016: It is now possible to have a reflecting plane at z=0 in the axisymtrical formulation. Examples are provided.

-6-2016: It is now possible to have a reflecting plane at z=0 in the 3D formulation. Examples are provided.

-9-2016: The c-constant calculation in the 3DBEM function point.m has been modified to consider interior field poits properly.

-3-2017: Patched bug in the definition of the 2D Green's function in intF1.m, lines 110-110. 

-4-2017: Boundary condition splitting is implemented in 2D, as it was in 3D. It only works with no impedance plane. An example is included, a duct.

-5-2020: Reduced progress messages in the command window - Near-singular integration functions are adapted and used also for singular integrals - AxiBEM: node splitting for mixed boundary conditions on single nodes
